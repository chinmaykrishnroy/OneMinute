# Verification

## Milestone 0 (2026-09-05)

Executed locally on Windows with Docker Desktop Linux containers:
- Go 1.26.5 unit tests and go vet passed for backend configuration/readiness, temporary ICE credentials and TURN configuration.
- TURN relay range regression test passed (including rejection of requested ports outside the range).
- Next.js 16.3.4 production build, TypeScript 6.0.3 typecheck and ESLint passed.
- Docker Compose built and started PostgreSQL/pgvector, Redis, migration job, API, web and TURN. All long-running services passed health checks.
- HTTP smoke passed for API liveness/readiness, web health, TURN health and landing page.
- In-app browser rendered the landing page.
- Real integration tests passed: migration applied twice without duplicate changes, pgvector exact cosine query, user/profile constraints, Redis TTL, STUN binding and authenticated TURN allocations over UDP and TCP.
- TURN was rebuilt with the additional range guard and returned healthy.

Run `./scripts/integration.ps1` against the running development stack. It uses temporary keys and rolled-back SQL writes, never FLUSHDB or database deletion. Go integration tests require explicit environment variables and are excluded from normal unit tests.

ESLint is pinned to 9.39.5 because the current Next.js React/import plugins fail with ESLint 10; upgrade the plugins together when compatible. This is a development dependency. Dependency installation audit reported no vulnerabilities.

Not claimed: real camera/microphone, browser-to-browser media, relay data transfer through external NATs, Google authentication, public deployment, distributed matchmaking, or CI execution. Those require the subsequent milestones.
